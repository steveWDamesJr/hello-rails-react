## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


## Pre-requisites
Make sure you have Ruby and Rails installed on your computer. If not, you can follow this [tutorial](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project) to install them.

If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, you can follow this [tutorial](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to install it.

If you don't have yarn installed, you can follow this [tutorial](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable) to install it.
  
## Usage
In your terminal, navigate to your current directory and run this code

`git clone git@github.com:steveWDamesJr/hello-rails-react.git`

Then run:

`cd hello-rails-react`

Open the project in your favorite code editor. `code .` for VS Code.

  - Use the command `bundle install` or just simply `bundle` to install all project dependencies.
  - Run `yarn install` to install all the JavaScript dependencies.
  - Run `yarn build:css` to build the CSS files.
  - Run `rails db:create db:migrate` to create the database and run migrations.
  - You might need to supply a username and password for your PostgreSQL database if you run into an error with the previous step.
  - Simply navigate to `config/database.yml` and add your username and password to the `username` and `password` fields.

  
Start terminal, webpack, and Tailwind transpilers:

`./bin/dev`

Copy and paste in the browser or click `http://127.0.0.1:3000` in the terminal output, and enjoy as your app opens in the web browser 


## Run Linters:

### To run rubocop we use:

`rubocop`

### To autocorrect offenses with rubocop we use:

`rubocop --auto-correct-all` or
`rubocop -A`

### Run linter for styling

`npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"`

### To autocorrect offenses with stylelint we use

`npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}" --fix`
